# Terrain_Gen

A project to create semi-realisitc, procedurally generated, randomized world maps for use with table-top style games. 

Hoping to adapt the project to 3D capabilites, randomized towns with procedurally generated contents and layouts. 

Further work will be made to make it directly work with pygame and maybe into Augment Reality style map viewer for remote playing with friends


Currently it does not support user-level modifications

Currently it does not register features, only makes them. 

Future improvements:
    Support user-defined procedural generations
    Smooth out diversity curves
    Create biomes
    Create towns 
    Create randomized feature names
